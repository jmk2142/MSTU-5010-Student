# MSTU 5010  
## Boundaries and Theories of Learning with Technological Artifacts

**Spring 2025**  
Teachers College, Columbia University

---

## Today’s Goals

- Get oriented to the course
- Get to know *how you think*
- Start exploring the **boundary between humans and AI**
- Play, experiment, and imagine

> This is not a lecture-heavy day.  
> Today is about *setting the tone*.

<!-- Emphasize: inquiry, play, seriousness without pressure -->

---

## What This Course Is (and Isn’t)

**This course is:**
- inquiry-driven
- studio-based
- theory *through* making
- serious about meaning, not just tools

**This course is not:**
- a step-by-step coding bootcamp
- a hype tour of AI tools
- a class with one “right” answer

<!-- Set expectations gently -->

---

## A Working Idea

### Learning happens at boundaries

- between humans and tools
- between intention and behavior
- between control and delegation
- between understanding and surprise

This course lives *there*.

---

## Why AI? Why Now?

AI isn’t just another tool.

It:
- responds
- adapts
- surprises
- sometimes *pushes back*

That makes it a **learning artifact**, not just software.

---

## How We’ll Think About This Course

We’ll use multiple lenses:
- learning sciences
- cognition
- sociocultural theory
- human-centered design
- ethics and responsibility

Not to “apply” them mechanically —  
but to **see** what’s happening.

---

## Before We Go Further…

### Quick In-Class Survey

Please take **5 minutes** to complete:

👉 **https://forms.gle/9eCvKfV2vtVPMXZX6**

This will directly shape today’s discussion  
and the direction of the course.

<!-- Pause here -->

---

## Key Question (from the survey)

### When you think about the *boundary* between human and AI…

**What intrigues you most?**

- Agency?
- Creativity?
- Control?
- Dependence?
- Ethics?
- Identity?
- Something else?

There are no wrong answers.

---

## Activity 1: Imagine the Boundary

### Small Group Brainstorm (10–15 min)

In groups of 3–4:

- Pick **one boundary** that interests you
- Imagine a *future* where this boundary is stretched
- Don’t solve it — **observe it**

Guiding prompts:
- Who is doing what?
- What feels helpful?
- What feels uncomfortable?
- What feels ambiguous?

---

## Activity 2: Sci-Fi Vignette

### Write a short speculative story

- ~5 short paragraphs
- near future or far future
- focused on *learning*, *thinking*, or *working* with AI

You may:
- outline together
- then use GPT to help generate the vignette
- revise or steer it as you like

This is about **ideas**, not prose quality.

---

## Share & Discuss

We’ll hear a few stories.

As we listen, we’ll ask:
- What assumptions about learning are embedded here?
- Where is agency located?
- What is gained?
- What is lost?
- What feels unresolved?

<!-- This is where you riff -->

---

## How This Connects to the Course

What you just did:
- framed a phenomenon
- explored it imaginatively
- surfaced assumptions
- noticed tensions

That’s *exactly* the kind of work we’ll keep doing —  
just with more theory, more code, and more depth.

---

## A Bit About Me (and Why This Course Exists)

I care about:
- how people think *with* systems
- how tools shape reasoning
- where responsibility lives
- what happens when we delegate cognition

I build:
- agentic systems
- local LLM workflows
- human-AI interaction experiments
- learning tools that behave in unexpected ways

This course grows out of that work.

## Tools We’ll Use

Today:
- Install **LM Studio**
- Run a local model
- Start poking at it

Later:
- code
- prompts
- agents
- memory
- orchestration
- critique

You don’t need to know everything coming in.

---

## Installing LM Studio

👉 https://lmstudio.ai

Steps:
1. Download and install
2. Pull a small model (we’ll recommend one)
3. Run a first prompt
4. Observe behavior — don’t judge it yet

<!-- Live walkthrough -->

---

## Final Thought for Today

This course isn’t about predicting the future.

It’s about learning how to:
- notice
- frame
- question
- and design responsibly

…when the boundaries keep moving.

---

## Next Time

- We’ll look more closely at **agency**
- We’ll start building small systems
- We’ll introduce theory as a *lens*, not a rulebook

Thanks for leaning into the uncertainty today.
