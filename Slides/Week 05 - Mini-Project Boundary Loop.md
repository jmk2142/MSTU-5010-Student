# Week 05
## Mini-Project: Boundary Loop

**Goal:** build a tiny experience that shows how input, model behavior, and output translation are shaped by the boundary you design.

---

## Where we are (arc)

- Week 02: payload literacy (see the boundary)
- Week 03: payload agency (intervene at the boundary)
- Week 04: output contracts (make outputs usable)
- **Week 05: build a full boundary loop**

---

## Today’s Activity (Poster Board)

Split your poster into **three sections**:

- **INPUT**
- **BLACK BOX**
- **OUTPUT**

We’ll brainstorm and share ideas for each section.

---

## Start With a Theme Word

Pick **one word** to guide your project.

Examples:
learning, trust, attention, emotion, power, fun, boredom, beauty, youth

Use this word to align your input, black box, and output decisions.

---

## Bonus: Choose a Theme for Me

As a class, pick **one theme word** for me to prototype.

If I have time this week, I’ll attempt a quick example and we’ll compare it to your poster ideas.

---

## INPUT (Poster Section)

**Prompt:** What boundary are you creating at the point of input?

Add:
- An input mode (text, form, sliders, buttons, media)
- One boundary lever (role, temperature, stop, structured input)
- A 1-line goal for the input experience

---

## BLACK BOX (Poster Section)

**Prompt:** What will you observe to learn how the model behaves?

Add:
- A model comparison (ex: 3B vs 14B)
- The evidence you’ll capture (raw JSON, debug trace, drift example)
- A 1-line hypothesis about what might change

---

## OUTPUT (Poster Section)

**Prompt:** How will output become a deterministic action?

Add:
- A contract (commands or JSON)
- The translation target (sound, visual, state change, simulation)
- One failure case + policy (reject/normalize/retry)

---

## Gallery Walk (Share)

- Walk the room and scan each poster.
- Leave one sticky note with a question or improvement.

---

## Debrief (Discuss)

- What input ideas felt most compelling?
- What did you plan to observe in the black box?
- What kinds of outputs felt most “alive” or meaningful?

---

## Next Steps

- Build your mini-project this week.
- Next class: **mini-demos** (it’s okay if it’s broken).
- Be ready to address: **input → black box → output**.
