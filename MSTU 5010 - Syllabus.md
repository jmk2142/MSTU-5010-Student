## Introduction

This course examines learning as a phenomenon that increasingly unfolds at the boundary between humans and technological artifacts. As computational systems — particularly AI and agentic tools — become embedded in how we think, create, and learn, traditional distinctions between tool use, cognition, and agency begin to blur.

Rather than treating technology as a neutral medium or AI as a standalone subject, this course approaches human–technology systems as sites of inquiry. We will explore how learning emerges through interaction with computational artifacts that students actively build, modify, and test. Coding in this course is not an end in itself, but a way of making learning processes visible — surfacing assumptions, constraints, and boundary conditions that shape both human and machine behavior.

Over the semester, students will engage theoretical perspectives from the learning sciences, cognitive science, sociocultural theory, and human-centered design as lenses for interpreting what they observe in these systems. Through hands-on coding activities, mini-challenges, and studio-style critique, students will investigate questions such as:

- Where does agency reside in human–AI interactions?
- What does it mean to learn with — or through — an adaptive system?
- How do representations, constraints, and feedback structures shape thinking and meaning-making?

The course is organized as a sequence of inquiry-driven studios rather than a linear progression of techniques. Students will move iteratively between building computational artifacts, observing their behavior in practice, and reflecting on those behaviors through theory-informed analysis. This cycle emphasizes sense-making over optimization and understanding over solutionism.

By the end of the course, students will have developed not only technical fluency in working with AI-driven systems, but a deeper capacity to articulate, critique, and evolve their own positions on learning, agency, and responsibility in hybrid human–machine environments. The goal is not to arrive at definitive answers, but to cultivate the intellectual tools needed to think carefully — and critically — when intelligence, authorship, and learning are no longer solely human.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze learning phenomena that emerge through hands-on interaction with technological artifacts**  
   Investigate how cognition, behavior, and agency shift when learning is mediated by computational systems they actively build, modify, and test.

2. **Use learning theories to interpret the behavior of coded systems and human–AI interactions**  
   Apply theoretical lenses to explain what they observe when humans interact with AI agents, simulations, and tool-augmented workflows.

3. **Design, implement, and critique small-scale agentic or AI-mediated systems**  
   Write and modify code that orchestrates models, tools, memory, or interaction loops, and analyze how design choices shape learning behavior.

4. **Examine boundaries of agency, authorship, and responsibility through computational experiments**  
   Use coding activities to surface questions about control, delegation, autonomy, and meaning in human–machine collaboration.

5. **Construct conceptual and computational models to explain learning with AI systems**  
   Produce both code and representational artifacts (e.g., schemas, diagrams, narratives) that articulate how learning unfolds in hybrid human–AI systems.

6. **Reflect on the epistemic and ethical implications of learning with agentic technologies**  
   Articulate evolving positions on what is gained, lost, or transformed when learning processes are partially delegated to machines.

## Course Structure and Flow

This course is organized into three inquiry-driven phases. Each phase emphasizes a different way of working, thinking, and making sense of human–AI learning systems. While the timing of phases is approximate, the course is designed to evolve responsively based on the questions, artifacts, and phenomena that emerge through our collective work.

### Phase I: Exploration and Boundary-Finding  
*(Approximately the first third of the semester)*

**Mode of work:** Exploration, experimentation, sense-making  
**Primary activities:** Mini-challenges, short builds, structured observation, discussion  
**Readings:** Light, flexible, often instructor-selected or student-sourced

In this phase, students explore learning as it unfolds through interaction with technological artifacts — particularly AI systems and agentic tools. Rather than beginning with stable definitions or established solutions, the emphasis is on encountering phenomena: building small systems, observing unexpected behaviors, and identifying tensions at the boundary between human intention and machine behavior.

**Guiding questions include:**
- What does it mean to learn with a technological artifact rather than merely through one?
- Where does agency appear to reside in human–AI systems?
- What assumptions about learning, intelligence, and control are embedded in our designs?

Coding activities in this phase are intentionally exploratory. Students write and modify code to surface questions rather than optimize outcomes. Theory is introduced as a way of seeing and naming emerging patterns, not as a framework to apply mechanically.

### Phase II: Framing, Theory, and Design Commitments  
*(Approximately the middle third of the semester)*

**Mode of work:** Framing, interpretation, and principled design  
**Primary activities:** Project proposals, deeper builds, theory-informed critique  
**Readings:** More substantial, aligned with student project directions

In this phase, students consolidate their interests into a focused design inquiry. The course shifts toward a project-based structure, with students developing a human–AI learning system, interaction, or experience that they will refine through the remainder of the term.

Theoretical perspectives from the learning sciences, cognitive science, sociocultural theory, and human-centered design are engaged more explicitly — always in relation to concrete design decisions. Readings are introduced strategically to support emerging project needs rather than to survey a fixed canon.

**Guiding questions include:**
- How do different theories explain what we are observing in our systems?
- What tradeoffs are we making between structure, autonomy, and guidance?
- How do representations, constraints, and feedback shape learning behavior?

### Phase III: Synthesis, Research, and Articulation  
*(Approximately the final third of the semester)*

**Mode of work:** Refinement, research, articulation, reflection  
**Primary activities:** Project development, peer critique, independent research  
**Readings:** Student-selected, project-driven

In the final phase, students focus on refining their projects and articulating what they have learned through both making and reflection. Students are expected to engage in independent research — drawing on relevant literature, precedents, and empirical observation — to inform and critique their designs.

The emphasis shifts from building new features to making sense of what has been built:

- What kind of learning does this system support — and what does it not?
- Where are the boundaries of agency, responsibility, and authorship?
- How has the student’s own stance toward human–AI learning evolved?

The course concludes with a public articulation of each project, emphasizing not only technical implementation, but the theoretical, epistemic, and ethical reasoning behind it.

> **Note:** Because this course engages rapidly evolving technologies and inquiry-driven projects, specific readings and tools may be introduced, adapted, or replaced as the semester unfolds. Any changes will be made transparently and in service of deeper learning.

## Major Assignments and Assessments

### Weekly Participation and Preparation (35%)

Students are expected to attend class regularly, complete assigned readings and preparatory work, and actively participate in studio discussions and activities.

Because this course is studio-based and inquiry-driven, most class sessions rely on artifacts produced before class. Weekly preparation may include (but is not limited to):

- short coding exercises or system experiments
- mini agentic or AI interaction challenges
- reflective prompts connecting theory to observed system behavior
- brief reading responses or discussion posts
- conceptual sketches, diagrams, or schemas

Students should be prepared to discuss not only what they built, but what they observed, questioned, and learned through the process.

*Participation is evaluated on preparedness, engagement, and evidence of thoughtful inquiry — not on technical polish alone.*

### Project Proposal: Boundary Inquiry (30%)  
**Group Assignment**

Students will develop a project proposal centered on a phenomenon, question, or tension at the boundary between humans and technological artifacts (e.g., AI systems, agentic workflows, computational tools).

The proposal should articulate:
- an area of interest or guiding question
- relevant theoretical or conceptual framing
- a proposed human–AI interaction, system, or experience
- a planned computational approach

This proposal is not a commitment to a final solution, but a commitment to an inquiry trajectory that integrates theory, design thinking, and computational exploration.

### Final Project: Human–AI Learning System (35%)  
**Group Assignment**

For the final project, students will design, implement, and reflect on a human–AI learning system, interaction, or experience that explores learning at a technological boundary.

The final project must include:
- **theoretical and conceptual analysis**
- **a practical or computational artifact**
- **a reflective synthesis** connecting theory, design decisions, and observed behavior

The goal of the final project is not technical completeness, but epistemic clarity — demonstrating how theory, design decisions, and computational behavior inform one another.

## Grading

| Assignment | Points / Percentage |
|---|---:|
| Weekly Participation and Preparation (i.e., cases, activities, discussion) | 35% |
| Project Proposal | 30% |
| Final Project | 35% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

Grades will be based on the following scale:  
A = 90–100%  
B = 80–89%  
C = 70–79%  
F = below 70%

This course does not offer a Pass/Fail option and must be taken for 3 credits. An A represents excellence within the expectations of the course.

### Syllabus Modifications

This syllabus represents the course plan at the start of the semester. Because the course is inquiry-driven and engages rapidly evolving technologies, readings, tools, activities, and timelines may be adjusted as the semester progresses.

Any changes will be communicated clearly and in advance, and will be made in service of student learning and the goals of the course.

## Policies (Attendance, Academic Integrity, etc.)

### Synchronous Video / Technical Requirements

To ensure clear audio transmissions, students should have an external communications headset (audio and mic) for video conferencing and an environment suitable for conducting class discussions (e.g., low background noise, etc.)

This course will be conducted mainly using Zoom video conferencing. Students are responsible for ensuring that their technical setup supports such applications and is configured correctly for voice and video transmission. Students are required to use their assigned tc.columbia.edu account in order to access these technology-based resources.

It is the student's responsibility to prepare, maintain, and troubleshoot technical issues regarding (but not limited to) video conferencing, social media usage, etc. While we do try to offer limited support, it is not possible for us to solve all technical issues as they can be highly specific to a particular user's computing environment.

### Course Recordings (To be determined)

On occasion students may encounter network connectivity problems (e.g., due to weather, outage, etc.) not allowing them to connect or attend class. Thus, this course may be recorded for archiving and sharing purposes. If so, classes may be available for students to see. Note however, that this is not a substitute for class attendance and students should be present for scheduled classes unless arrangements are made with the instructor. See **Attendance**.

### Course Adaptations and Accommodations for Disabilities

The College will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Access and Services for Individuals with Disabilities (OASID) for information about registration.

You can reach OASID by email at oasid@tc.columbia.edu, stop by 163 Thorndike Hall, or call 212-678-3689. Services are available only to students who have registered and submitted appropriate documentation.

As your instructor, I am happy to discuss specific needs with you as well. Please report any access-related concerns about instructional material to OASID and to me as your instructor.

### Activating Columbia University Network ID (UNI)

Teachers College students have the responsibility for activating the Columbia University Network ID (UNI) and a free TC Gmail account. As official communications from the College — e.g., information on graduation, announcements of closing due to severe storm, flu epidemic, transportation disruption, etc. — will be sent to the student’s TC Gmail account, students are responsible for either reading email there or utilizing the mail forwarding option to forward mail from their account to an email address which they will monitor.

### Incomplete Statement Policy

The grade of Incomplete will be assigned only when the course attendance requirement has been met but, for reasons satisfactory to the instructor, the granting of a final grade has been postponed because certain course assignments are outstanding.

If the outstanding assignments are completed within one calendar year from the date of the close of term in which the grade of Incomplete was received and a final grade submitted, the final grade will be recorded on the permanent transcript, replacing the grade of Incomplete, with a transcript notation indicating the date that the grade of Incomplete was replaced by a final grade.

If the outstanding work is not completed within one calendar year from the date of the close of term in which the grade of Incomplete was received, the grade will remain as a permanent Incomplete on the transcript. In such instances, if the course is a required course or part of an approved program of study, students will be required to re-enroll in the course including repayment of all tuition and fee charges for the new registration and satisfactorily complete all course requirements.

If the required course is not offered in subsequent terms, the student should speak with the faculty advisor or Program Coordinator about their options for fulfilling the degree requirement. Doctoral students with six or more credits with grades of Incomplete included on their program of study will not be allowed to sit for the certification exam.

### Attendance

It is the policy of Teachers College to respect its members’ observance of their major religious holidays. Students should notify instructors at the beginning of the semester about their wishes to observe holidays on days when class sessions are scheduled.

Where academic scheduling conflicts prove unavoidable, no student will be penalized for absence due to religious reasons, and alternative means will be sought for satisfying the academic requirements involved. If a suitable arrangement cannot be worked out between the student and the instructor, students and instructors should consult the appropriate department chair or director. If an additional appeal is needed, it may be taken to the Provost.

### Sexual Harassment and Violence Reporting

Teachers College is committed to maintaining a safe environment for students. Because of this commitment and because of federal and state regulations, we must advise you that if you tell any of your instructors about sexual harassment or gender-based misconduct involving a member of the campus community, your instructor is required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator, Janice Robinson.

She will treat this information as private, but will need to follow up with you and possibly look into the matter. The Ombuds officer for Gender-Based Misconduct is a confidential resource available for students, staff and faculty. "Gender-based misconduct" includes sexual assault, stalking, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and gender-based harassment.

For more information, see: http://sexualrespect.columbia.edu

### Late Policy

Students are expected to complete their assignments by their scheduled due date. Turning in papers late puts you behind on the next assignment.

Late assignments are subject to penalty (5% deducted per day from their given grade) unless prior arrangements have been made. If you are not handing a paper directly to me, you are responsible for confirming that I have received the work on time.

Extensions will be given only under truly extraordinary circumstances. Advanced notice regarding these extraordinary circumstances will permit me to be more flexible. If you are too ill to meet the deadline scheduled, please send an email (or have someone email for you) regarding your illness prior to class time. Written verification of illness by either a physician or the student health center may be required.

### Academic Integrity

The University Academic Integrity Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic course work. Students who intentionally submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to the original source, fabricate data or other information, engage in cheating, or misrepresentation of academic records may be subject to charges. Sanctions may include dismissal from the college for violation of the TC principles of academic and professional integrity fundamental to the purpose of the College.

All infractions are to be reported. The policy on academic integrity states: "Students who intentionally submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to the original source, fabricate data or other information, engage in cheating, or misrepresentation of academic records may be subject to charges. Sanctions may include dismissal from the college for violation of the TC principles of academic and professional integrity fundamental to the purpose of the College."

The policy can be found at: http://www.tc.columbia.edu/diversity

Plagiarism/cheating will not be accepted in any assignments, papers, or exams. Forgetting to put in a quote, failing to cite a reference in text will not be acceptable. Any student handing in a paper with extensive plagiarism or handing in someone else's paper from the current or a previous semester will receive a zero and may be referred to the administration for disciplinary action. A second incident, no matter how minor will result in an F in the class. The response that you did not know or realize what you were doing will not be accepted.

Definitions of plagiarism and cheating can be obtained at: http://www.tc.columbia.edu/graduate-writing-center

### AI Policy

As new LLM and generative AI tools emerge (tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.), we have to reflect on how these tools can be both useful as well as a barrier to our joint knowledge construction process.

There’s a difference between thinking with technology and letting technology do the thinking. With this in mind, we will use the following AI policy in this course:

**Permitted uses:** You may choose to use generative AI tools for the following activities:
- helping you find background information about a topic
- generating summaries or explanations of challenging material for your own reflection
- drafting outlines to help you organize your thoughts
- assisting with improving grammar and style

**Not permitted:** You are not allowed to use generative AI tools to draft writing assignments. If you want to include AI content in class assignments, this content must be treated as any other external information and properly cited.

Using generative AI to generate text or artifacts and then trying to turn it in as your own work will be treated in the same manner as plagiarism. This includes reading reactions, paper assignments, and design projects. When in doubt, be transparent. If you used an AI tool, disclose it.

### Public Course Repository and Student Contributions

This course uses a shared GitHub repository as a primary organizer for materials, code, and student work. Many class artifacts (e.g., code, prompts, write-ups, design notes, examples, and documentation) may be added to the repository as part of the ongoing course record.

Because the repository is designed to be a **living course resource**, student contributions may remain available to classmates and to future students taking this course. In other words: your work may have a longer life than a single semester, and you will help shape the course for the next cohort.

- Students should assume that contributions committed to the course repository are visible to others enrolled in the course and may be retained for future instructional use.
- Students who prefer not to have a specific artifact retained beyond the semester should contact the instructor to discuss alternatives (e.g., anonymization, removing identifying information, or submitting via a private channel).

Please be thoughtful about what you choose to include in public-facing materials and avoid sharing personal, sensitive, or identifying information in repository posts or commits.

### Content Notice: Frontier Technologies and Sensitive Materials

This course examines learning at the boundary of humans and technological artifacts — including emerging and experimental AI systems. As a result, we may occasionally encounter outputs, examples, or discussion topics that are ethically complex, socially charged, or simply uncomfortable.

In some cases, we may analyze models or configurations that are less filtered than mainstream tools (e.g., open-weight or minimally constrained models) in order to study boundary behaviors, safety tradeoffs, and the implications of design decisions. We will approach this work in a scholarly and reflective way, with attention to context and care in discussion.

Students should be prepared for the possibility of encountering content that includes, for example: biased language, disturbing themes, or other unexpected outputs that can surface when working with frontier systems.

If at any point you have concerns about course content, or if a particular topic creates discomfort that interferes with your learning, please reach out to the instructor. Where possible, we will make reasonable adjustments (e.g., alternative materials, modified tasks, or different examples) while still maintaining the intellectual aims of the course.

### Emergency Plan

TC is prepared for a wide range of emergencies. After declaring an emergency situation, the President/Provost will provide the community with critical information on procedures and available assistance.

If travel to campus is not feasible, instructors will facilitate academic continuity through Canvas and other technologies, if possible.

It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that they are set to receive email notifications from TC and communications from their instructor at their TC email address.

Within the first two sessions for the course, students are expected to review and be prepared to follow the instructions stated in the emergency plan. The plan may consist of downloading or obtaining all available readings for the course or the instructor may provide other instructions.
