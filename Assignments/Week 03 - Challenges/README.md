# Week 03 — Challenges (try at home)

In class, we’ll focus on **Activity 1** (LM Studio hookup + payload inspection).

After class, choose **one** challenge pack below. Each pack is a tiny “experience” that connects:
- a **human idea** (agency, memory, governance, uncertainty, perspective), to
- a **boundary design choice** (how we shape inputs and/or how we use outputs).

You can either **emulate** one pack (run it and document what you notice) or **extend** it (make one small change).

## Before you start (required)
Complete the Week 03 demo first:
- `Demos/Week 03/Activity 1 - LM Studio Hookup + Payload Inspection/`

## Choose one challenge pack (pick 1)
All challenge packs live here:
- `Assignments/Week 03 - Challenges/Challenge Packs/`

- **Activity 2 — Policy as Governance**
  - rules/policy shape behavior
  - input move: swap policy templates (`system`)

- **Activity 3 — Memory is Designed**
  - “memory” is what context we include
  - input move: change `messages[]` with `--memory` / `--context`

- **Activity 4 — Dependence and Delegation**
  - delegation changes responsibility/understanding
  - output move: require assumptions/uncertainty before answers

- **Activity 5 — Interpretation Pipeline**
  - meaning emerges when outputs are used to do things
  - output move: parse model output into a deterministic schedule artifact

- **Activity 6 — Perspective Taking**
  - framing can center/erase perspectives
  - output move: keep perspectives separated with a constrained format

- **Activity 7 — Uncertainty Routing**
  - uncertainty can be surfaced or hidden
  - output move: route what gets printed based on `confidence`

## How to work (recommended process)
1) Run the baseline once with `--debug`.
   - Read the request JSON. Read the response JSON.
2) Change one variable at a time (2–3 experiments).
3) Extend the demo (one small change).

## What to bring next class
Bring any combination of:
- One screenshot/snippet of a request payload that surprised you
- One output snippet that revealed a boundary
- One small code change you made (optional) + why
- 1–2 questions you want to discuss

## Safety + hygiene
- Don’t include passwords, tokens, or personal data in logs.
- If you’re unsure whether something is appropriate to publish, don’t publish it.
